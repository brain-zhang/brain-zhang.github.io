在Github的Issue里面经常见到一堆`ACK`，原来知道肯定不是TCP的ACK，估计是acknowledge之类的缩写，但是一直不求甚解。

<!-- more -->

今天心血来潮搜了一下，嗯，猜的也差不多:

* LGTM—looks good to me

* ACK—acknowledgement, i.e. agreed/accepted change

* NACK/NAK —negative acknowledgement, i.e. disagree with change and/or concept

* RFC—request for comments, i.e. I think this is a good idea, lets discuss

* WIP—work in progress, do not merge yet

* AFAIK/AFAICT—as far as I know / can tell

* IIRC—if I recall correctly

* IANAL—“I am not a lawyer”, but I smell licensing issues

像比特币代码仓库里还经常见到:

* Concept ACK—agree with the concept, but haven’t reviewed the changes

* utACK (aka. Untested ACK)—agree with the changes and reviewed them, but didn’t test

* Tested ACK—agree with the changes, reviewed and tested
